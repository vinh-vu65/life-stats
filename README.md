# life-stats
A simple app where users can add an activity and increment the counter every time they complete the activity.

The app should track the date of when the activity was added, or add support for editting and adding activities retroactively.

Activities can be sorted into custom made categories for easy sorting.

The app will include a calendar view where users can view their recorded activities for the day.

Users can set goals/targets for each activity which can be to increase or decrease the occurrence of the activity.

### Future:
- Login/Sync for multi device use (will require a db)
- Export data to pretty graphs



## Learning goals
- Github actions for CI/CD
- AWS services for deployment with my own CFN templates (ECR, Fargate etc.)
- Complete the project kata
- Implement my own end to end app for the web and potentially mobile
- Learning about auth and db management
